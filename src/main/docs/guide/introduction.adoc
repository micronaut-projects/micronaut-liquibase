The Micronaut Liquibase integration runs Liquibase changelogs. It does not create changelogs.

To use the Micronaut's integration with http://www.liquibase.org[Liquibase] you must have the `micronaut-liquibase`
dependency on your classpath:

dependency:micronaut-liquibase[groupId="io.micronaut.liquibase"]
