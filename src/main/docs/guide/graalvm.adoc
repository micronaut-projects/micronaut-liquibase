Micronaut Liquibase is compatible with https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] so it is possible
to create native images and run the migrations during application startup.

Everything is handled automatically by the library so users don't need any special configuration.

NOTE: See the section on https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#graal[GraalVM] in the user guide for more
information.
